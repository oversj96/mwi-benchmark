## Communication - (Both Emails Given)

*I know the requirements asked for one email, but doing both doesn't take very long and I think it gives a better range of understanding to the various needs in crafting an email.*

### Email 1 - FTP Information

- Hi [client's name], <br>
  <br>
  To get access to the code so that we can begin analyzing and working on the project, we will need from you a set of credentials for FTP (File Transfer Protocol). This consists of a username and password like you would require for logging onto a computer, and a server IP address which will take this form: "192.168.1.10:27017". I understand if this request is confusing, and if you require my help or need me to further explain the credentials I am available for email anytime, or I can setup a call so we can talk this through. I'm here to help! <br>
  <br>
  Thank you,<br>
  Justin Overstreet

### Email 2 - More Requirements Gathering Needed

- Good [morning/afternoon/evening] [client's name],
  <br>
  <br>
  We are currently working on the, "About Us," page for your website, and we are in need of a few pictures of your team and details that you would like us to share on the page about your operation and the achievements or benefits that you've provided. We can also display details about the team members themselves if you'd prefer, dealing more closely to the individuals rather than the group at large. Really, the name of this page says it all, it's what you want your prospective clients to know, "about us." I will need this sooner rather than later however, as the requested deadline for this project is approaching.<br>
  <br>
  Thank you, <br>

## Code Test

Any details you'd like to mention about your code test.

- Please navigate to "justin_overstreet_05-2021" and run **npm install** or **yarn install**. *Note that this will require nodejs to be installed.*  

- Next, run **npm start** or **yarn start**, depending on what package manager you prefer best.

- Notes about the test page itself

  - I tried as well as I could to follow the general scheme that the mock-ups gave. I wasn't sure how much I should deviate with things like, "Heading One," in whether or not these were just placeholders that I could creatively change, so I left them alone and they should appear as they do on the mockup page.

  - Since any library was fair game I approached development of the page much like I would for a client, using technologies that I was more familiar with and could get the best scaling and ease of maintenance on. This meant react, material-ui for layout, etc.

  - I used **Typescript** mostly because I feel like it's good practice to use typescript and maintain the advantage of intellisense in text editors or IDEs that support it, and to help prevent run-time surprises.

  - The library I used to help manage the form was chosen because of its consistency with react hooks. I've used just pure hooks to manage form state before, and I've also used redux, and really for such a simple form any number of form management libraries would've been fine I think.

    - The form submits its data to an alert, and clears upon clicking okay.

  - As for the puzzle, it felt like poor user experience to click the link to solve and leave the page sitting untouched, as I noticed the list would render below but you wouldn't notice anything had happened until you scrolled down. I solved this by attaching a ref to the last list item and scrolling it into view when it finished rendering.

  - I tried to leave comments throughout my code to indicate some kind of rationale behind things. I am open to email dialogue at anytime if I need to explain something!

  - **Regardless of the result of this benchmark, any feedback on how I approached this benchmark would be greatly appreciated!**
