## Communication

### Email 1 - FTP Information

- Hi [client's name], <br>
  <br>
  To get access to the code so that we can begin analyzing and working on the project, we will need from you a set of credentials for FTP (File Transfer Protocol). This consists of a username and password like you would require for logging onto a computer, and a server IP address which will take this form: "192.168.1.10:27017". I understand if this request is confusing, and if you require my help or need me to further explain the credentials I am available for email anytime, or I can setup a call so we can talk this through. <br>
  <br>
  Thank you,<br>
  Justin Overstreet

### Email 2 - More Requirements Gathering Needed

- Hi [client's name],
  <br>
  <br>
  We are currently working on the, "About Us," page for your website, and we are in need of a few pictures of your team and details that you would like us to share on the page about your operation and the achievements or benefits that you've provided. We can also display details about the team members themselves if you'd prefer, dealing more closely to the individuals rather than the group at large. Really, the name of this page says it all, it's what you want your prospective clients to know, "about us." I will need this sooner rather than later however, as the requested deadline for this project is approaching.<br>
  <br>
  Thank you, <br>
  Justin Overstreet
